"""Per-microbatch routing for :class:`MultiLinearLoRA` (MLL) layers.

NeMo-RL's train loop iterates over microbatches, calling
``model.forward(...)`` once per microbatch. Each microbatch is a slice
``[mb_start : mb_start + mb_size]`` of the global batch. Routing must
push the matching slice of per-row adapter ids to every MLL layer
before each forward.

Contract:

- The caller (worker ``train``) calls :func:`seed_microbatch_routing` once
  per ``policy.train(...)`` invocation, passing the FULL batch's per-row
  adapter ids as a ``LongTensor[B]`` indexed into the canonical adapter
  slot order (see :class:`MultiLinearLoRA`'s ``lora_A[ids]`` semantics).

- The pre-hook installed on ``model`` then advances a cursor by
  ``input_ids.shape[0]`` each forward, slices the next chunk, and calls
  ``sub.set_routing(chunk_ids)`` on every MLL submodule.

Ids are GLOBAL — i.e., the same int means the same adapter across every
forward in the step. No local renumbering, no name→id map.
